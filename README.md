# leaflet_visualization_of_earthquake_data
Using Javascript libraries Leaflet and jquery, created map of USGS recorded seismic activity with two UI layers to choose from and a time slider.

1. Import & Visualize the Data

-Plotted all earthquake data using Leaflet markers based on occurrences longitude and latitude.
-Reflected the magnitude of the earthquake in the data markers size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are larger and darker in color.
-Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when the marker is clicked.
-Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.

2. Add Fault lines and time-series layer to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity and/or areas of recorded seismic activity over time. 

-Pulled in a second data set and visualized it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates from: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
-Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
-Added layer controls to the map.
